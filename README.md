# Dungeon Game
A simple dungeon crawler to learn object-oriented related techniques.

- @dataclass
- NamedTuple (from typing)
- Basic typing specification
- As fully object-oriented as I could.

The play through is very simple. Name your hero, select a class and start battling monsters. 
The combat isn't well-balanced and it will most probably stay that way.
